    Around one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets lost or wasted i.e. never reaches a hungry stomach. What if the food left unused or produced in excess by some could reach the ones who have none! A few social groups and NGOs have initiated efforts to gather excess food and distribute it to the needy but can they reach out to everybody?

    What if there was a simple way to connect ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’? What if the location of the food getting wasted and the people who need them was just a click away for them to link up? Dabba4U does exactly the same to fight against food wastage.
