Let the extra food from a party or an event reach to the hungry via Food App, Dabba4U

Abundance of edibles left from the last night party? Are you clueless about what to do with them?

Dabba4U has been designed to enable people from every nook and corner of the city, to advertise about the remaining food from an event.

Food is an integral part of a wedding or a party and it often gets wasted. It is then where Dabba4U comes into the picture to rescue you, making way for reaching it to the orphanages, old age homes or to the people whose abode is on the streets.
